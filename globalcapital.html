    <h1>GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKET STRATEGY</h1>
       <p> Emerging Markets are flooded with business opportunities, however the missing link for most emerging markets is their ability to attract and retain global capital. Promoters of projects, leadership of businesses and even public officials with responsibilities for building new infrastructure, are all in the race to secure global capital to expand the horizons of their business and respond to commercial opportunities in their marketplace. </p>
       
       <p><font size ="6"> The Platforms and procedure we have adopted include the following:</font></p>
     
     <h2>Global Capital Road Show:</h2>
     <p> takes corporate leaders on a journey into the World of International Finance, linking and hosting executives who run companies or projects that require  
         global capital, with investment managers, fund managers and investment advisers that are seeking opportunities for investment in emerging markets. Our Road Show experience provides executives promoting capital intensive projects with the dynamics, the understanding, the structure and the partnerships that you will require to fund projects as diverse as re-entry works for a Nigerian Oil field, processing machinery for a cocoa farm in Ghana, Coastal shipping and vessel services for the West African energy industry or consolidation of a South African Entertainment conglomerate. 
         We are particularly great at assisting corporations listed on a local African stock exchange to attract global capital by the issuing of US based depository receipts or global depository receipts.</p> 

      <p> <font size=" 6"> Global Capital Access: with particular focus on: </font></p>
      <h1>STRATEGY. PROJECTS. INVESTMENTS. </h1>
      <h2>Strategy</h2>
      <p>Our experts will define for you what it takes to win the hearts and minds of global investors. We will expose you, on the Road Show, to the fundamentals of securing and winning Global Capital on a sustainable basis. We will support you to secure global capital for your qualified registered projects, and we will offer you unique and exclusive participation in pre-approved projects that may meet your investment profile and tolerance. In some cases, the best strategy may be to seek capital from the Global Capital Markets, issuing securities that will be traded internationally and in other cases it may be straight debt from a tier 1 or a tier 2 financial institution. Whichever the case may be, we will support you, to develop the best strategy that works for you.</p>
      <h2>Projects</h2>
      <p>You can register your qualified projects to be promoted on each Road Show. This will mean that our experts will ensure that your projects are matched with potential strategic qualified investors. We support you to repackage and reposition your registered projects to meet the standards and the sophistication of Global Investors’ presentations. Our road show is only the beginning; it is designed to expand your horizon of available capital for your company or your project to include Global Capital. After the Road Show, we will work closely with you to meet the terms of engagement as stipulated by International investors. </p>
      <h2>Investments </h2>
      <p>Your goal is to get global capital flowing towards your project and your company, and that’s our goal as well. In this respect, once the Road Show is over, we work with you to meet the requirements set forth by global investors and we ensure that your company and your projects eventually get the investment capital you require. In some exceptional cases, if you qualify, we may include you or your company in a pre-approved global investment project as an early adopter. Early adopters for pre-approved global investment projects are best positioned to receive favorable investment treatment and terms for their own projects from the same investment funds that have funded the pre-approved global investment project.</p>

    <h1>LOCAL CONTENT STRATEGIC INITIATIVE</h1>
    <h2>About Local Content Strategic Initiative</h2>
    <p>The Local Content Strategic Initiative is designed to support local economies of communities, regions, states and nations that support the operations of 
       large scale extractive and heavy industries. The LCSI does this by providing a path to the development and inclusion of local entrepreneurs, communities, youths and women.  We build continuous and sustainable support structures for Local Content certified companies operating in the oil, gas and energy industry value chain. The Local Content Strategic Initiative has a number of schemes, programs and projects designed to impact the local, regional and national economies by creating new entrepreneurs, promoting the creation of new jobs and providing a framework for the empowerment and support of communities, youths and women. It is about enhancing the capacity of the Nation to be in a positon to support the large economy and the industry with the right skills, the right international partnerships, the right technology and the right equipment and the right financing. The Local Content Strategic Initiative supports the mentorship of Small and Medium businesses in the value chain of the energy industry so that local entrepreneurs can build capacity to become global players within short time frames. </p>
       <h2>Local Content Strategy</h2>
       <h2>For National Development, International Partnerships and Nation Building </h2>
       <h2 style = "color: red;"> National Development;</h2>
       <p>Local Content is consistent with National Development, so we work with Regulators and Officials to develop a Local Content Strategy for you that are in line with the local Nation’s National Development goals. This could mean developing a broad based value chain when working with Local Content companies and Entrepreneurs, providing a broad based approach to equipment and technology or in some cases providing support structures for access to capital and investment. </p>
       <h2 style="color: red;">Community Content and Community Development;</h2>
       <p>Local Content is also about community development and inclusion. So we work with officials and Energy Companies to provide the community with a broad based path way for inclusion which is sustainable and ensures acceptability from community leaders and youth members. Our community content strategy always includes providing a sustainable economic base for the community that supports wealth and job creation, during and after production activities. As well as a unique focus on cleaning up the environment and setting in place a sustainable system of environmental protection.</p>
       <h2 style="color: red;">Local Content Entrepreneurship Development Program for Women;</h2>
       <p>we provide a special focus on Women which is not only included as a part of your Local Content Strategy but can be used to really impact your production areas and the Nation at large. Our program is a five year fully engaged program which includes training, practical business scenarios, site visits, practical internships, mentorships, and even international road shows and excursions. Our Entrepreneurs also participate in a business and organizational mentorship program in which value chain vendors and contractors can be enrolled into our long-term mentorship program which includes IOC training, regulator guidance and global market exposure.</p>
       <h2 style="color: red;">Local Content Entrepreneurship Development Program for Small Business;</h2>
       <p> we equally provide a special focus for small and medium scale enterprises. Our program is a two-year intensive program which includes training, access to investment and funding, exposure to practical applications of the oil and gas industry and international road shows. 
       Youth Empowerment; Local Content is consistent with youth development and empowerment. The right skills, the right opportunities and the right pathway to progress for youths, including support systems and structures for sustainable economic enterprise. We make sure that youth groups are carried along from the beginning of exploration and production activities in the community. Our tested design makes sure that youths do not disrupt exploration or production activities as they are fully engaged with our mobile empowerment centres learning a skill and developing a business idea.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Anabel espouses the use of quality local goods and services, trained and qualified Nigerian personnel, contractors and suppliers in compliance that first consideration is given to local content.
        Some of our key programs are:
       </p>
       <h1>1. COMMUNITY ENGAGEMENT</h1>
       <p>At the inception of a project, Anabel provides customized partner-company branded solar-powered, mobile containers outfitted as either health centres, training centres or project offices. This shows up in the catchment community to provide medical check-ups/basic primary medical services with trained medical personnel, oil value-chains counselling and orientation, empowerment training on Information Technology, phone repairs, grooming etc. to kick-start community-based non-oil based economic activities.</p>
       <p>A pictorial representation of the customized mobile container that can be deployed on land and sea is attached.</p>
       <br>
       <h1>2. TRAINING</h1>
       <p>This is an integral part of Anabel’s philosophy. When people know better, they do better. Training is provided to impart and enhance skills in business, social interaction, attitude, work methods, technical improvement, presentation and vocations.</p>
       <br>
       <p>A diverse mix of professionals make up the faculty, who bring their knowledge and skill sets to bear in imparting the trainees. As the operator of the NCDMB’s Project Triple E (3E), Anabel has initiated the Nigerian Content Master Class (NCMC) series. Kindly see attached flyer.</p>
       <h1>3. YOUTH EMPOWERMENT</h1>
       <p>The bulk of the demographics of the Nigerian nation are tilted towards the youths. This group is also the most technological, trained, creative and agitated.</p>
       <br>
       <p>How to galvanise this energy towards productive activities and personal development/performance goals is the main thrust of Anabel’s Youth Empowerment Scheme (YES) and SAFETY (Strategic Alliance for the Education and Training of Youths). We address this through regular planned and systematic counselling, mentoring, motivation and skills training.</p>
       <h1>4. WOMEN EMPOWERMENT</h1>
       <p>Women play a pivotal role in community and national development. Often, the women are seen but are not heard; they are not in the drivers’ seat in the decision-making processes that ultimately affect them.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Anabel promotes the education and training of women in the oil and gas value chain, business and entrepreneurial skills; and subsequently provide opportunities for mentoring, cooperation and international exposures.</p>
       <h1>5. ENTREPRENEURSHIP DEVELOPMENT</h1>
       <p>Moving from individualized skills training that characterized the early implementation of the NOGICD Act, and equipped people for work as employees; Anabel is taking it a notch higher to building business owners, entrepreneurs and businesses through capacity development, international exposures, mentoring and match-making.</p>
       <br>
       <p>Emphasis on Global Best Practices, Quality Standards and Customer Focus are key components of this programme</p>
       <br>
       <p>International Energy Companies, Operators and the Energy value chain </p>
       <br>
       <p>We support International energy companies operating or seeking to operate in the African Energy industry, to create, realize and enhance their value through the successful integration of Local Content.</p>
       <br>
       <p>We will support your extractive and energy operations</p>
       <ul>
         <li>To guide, inform, and advise in making the best choices on certified Local Content partners, approved by the Regulators who have undergone approved Regulatory screening, training, and verification.</li>
         <li>Support your expatriate executives and staff in ethics, codes and customs in doing business in the Local environment including Nigeria, Angola and Equatorial Guinea. This process entails counselling sessions, training sessions, diversity sessions, community issues and the oil & gas investment climate. We also provide you and your staff with a robust understanding of the geo-political situation in these African Nations’ political environment.</li>
         <li>Making the right choices also includes helping you select support services and partners including legal, accounting and other professional services that you require to build a world class operation in Africa.</li>
         <li>To help your transition into Nigeria, Angola, Ghana or Equatorial Guinea, we will provide a secure and seamless process by which your company can identify and partner Local Content partners that will make up  your entire African value chain of suppliers, vendors and service providers taking full advantage of the capacity of all Local Content providers in the entire energy, oil and gas industry of Africa.</li>
         <li>Working with us gives you a unique access to Regulatory approved community and youth development and empowerment schemes, which are operated by Anabel Group. These schemes are targeted at creating entrepreneurs at the micro level to enhance economic activity and create new jobs. Our approach endorsed and in use by the Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board, uses strategic unique engagement tools including but not limited to our Mobile Empowerment Centres on Wheels and our Floating Mobile Empowerment Centres on barges, which allows access to communities typically evident in the energy, oil and gas producing areas of Africa. Our community content and youth development strategy has the ability to cover all oil and gas communities in Africa offering you a veritable platform to partner with communities and engage the youths by creating sustainable economic activity and new jobs swhich always reduces the incidence of youth restiveness and guarantees smooth oil exploration and production activity for the long term. </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <h2>Local Companies</h2>
        <p>Our Local Content Strategy promotes the inclusion of all Local Content providers in production, operations, projects, vessels, drilling, engineering services, and well head engineering in Africa’s energy industry and in particular the oil and gas industry. In recognition of our efforts, we are currently working with the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board as operator for the NCDMB’s Project Triple E designed to support the enhanced capacity and the development of special products, special skills and special groups within the oil and gas industry including but not limited to entrepreneurs, micro, small and medium scale enterprises as well as youths and women. The NCDMB’s Project Triple E is also targeted at supporting the financial structure of Nigeria Content companies; supporting the development of communities as well as the empowerment and training of youths.</p>
        <br>
        <p>The Anabel Group is working for the strategic positioning of locally manufactured goods and Nigerian oil and gas service companies that have been certified and are qualified Nigeria Content product or service providers. We are creating opportunities for partnership and encouraging the development of indigenous SMEs with the tenacity to take the Nigerian oil and gas industry to the next level. Our work with the Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board has exposed us to a very unique range of opportunities for Local Content providers which have not been exploited, largely because most Nigerian firms operating in the oil and gas industry have not yet seen the need to develop a comprehensive Local Content Strategy.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>SUPPORT FOR LOCAL CONTENT MANUFACTURERS & SERVICES</h1>
        <p>At the Anabel Group, we are making a shift in business practices in the oil and gas sector, allowing you more access to international oil and gas companies and original equipment manufacturers’ partnerships. Through our network with international energy companies we are able to bridge the gap between you and them ensuring that your services become a part of the value chain of Africa’s oil and gas production processes.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>WORLD CLASS OPERATIONS AND STRATEGIC SKILLS</h1>
        <p>Our work with oil and gas service providers on behalf of Regulators such as the Nigerian Content Development and Monitoring Board provides us with a unique insight into the support that is available to you as well as the knowledge you will need to succeed over the long term as you build your business empire. We can extend that knowledge and expertise to supporting you directly to gain the skills to win some of the most sophisticated and lucrative tenders in the different energy markets of Africa and especially the Nigerian oil and gas industry.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>FOSTERING JOINT VENTURE PARTNERSHIPS</h1>
        <p>With our network, we will match make you with international oil and gas companies and international original equipment manufacturers looking to meet their local content quota. In fulfilling our mandate to support the inclusion of local content, we will walk you through the process, develop your capacity, train your staff, and go the extra mile to ensure that you and your personnel have the sophistication and the skills required to consummate relationships with the international oil & gas companies.</p>
        <br>
        <h1>PROJECT SUPPORT INSTRUMENT (FUNDING SUPPORT)</h1>
        <p>In addition to Local Content business strategy, we also specialize in financial strategy, supporting you to raise international funding needed to support your local projects, which may include; IOC contracts, drilling operations, yard operations, production or fabrication facilities, vessel operations and equity partnerships to invest in acreage ownership</p>
        <br>
        <h1>COMMUNITY CONTENT, YOUTH EMPOWERMENT, ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT STRATEGY</h1>
        <p>We currently support Nigeria Content Development and Monitoring Board community content, youth empowerment and community development schemes as part of our mandate to operate NCDMB’s Project Triple E and the Local Content Strategic Initiative.
