<h4>Strategy</h4>
<p>Our experts will define for you what it takes to win the hearts and minds of global investors.
We will expose you, on the Road Show, to the fundamentals of securing and winning Global
Capital on a sustainable basis. We will support you to secure global capital for your qualified
registered projects, and we will offer you unique and exclusive participation in pre-approved
projects that may meet your investment profile and tolerance. In some cases, the best
strategy may be to seek capital from the Global Capital Markets, issuing securities that will be
traded internationally and in other cases it may be straight debt from a tier 1 or tier 2 financial
institution. Whichever the case may be we will support you, to develop the best strategy that
works for you. </p>

<h4>Projects</h4>
<p>You can register your qualified projects to be promoted on each Road Show. This will mean
that our experts will ensure that your projects are matched with potential strategic qualified
investors. We support you to repackage and reposition your registered projects to meet the
standards and the sophistication of Global Investors’ presentations. Our road show is only the
beginning, it is designed to expand your horizon of available capital for your company or your
project to include Global Capital. After the Road Show, we will work closely with you to meet
the terms of engagement as stipulated by International investors.</p>

<h4>Investment</h4>
<p>Your ultimate goal is to get global capital flowing towards your project and your company,
and that’s our goal as well. In this respect, once the Road Show is over, we work with you to
meet the requirements set forth by global investors and we ensure that your company and
your projects eventually get the investment capital you require. In some exceptional cases, if
you qualify, we may include you or your company in a pre-approved global investment project
as an early adopter. Early adopters for pre-approved global investment projects, are best
positioned to receive favorable investment treatment and terms for their own projects
from the same investment funds that have funded the
pre-approved global investment project.</p>
