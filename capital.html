 <p>Emerging Markets are flooded with business opportunities, however the missing
link for most emerging markets is their ability to attract and retain global capital.
Promoters of projects, leadership of businesses and even public officials with
responsibilities for building new infrastructure, are all in the race to secure global
capital to expand the horizons of their business and respond to commercial
opportunities in their marketplace.</p>

intensive projects with the dynamics, the understanding, the structure and the
partnerships that you will require to fund projects as diverse as re-entry works

of a South African Entertainment conglomerate.</p>
